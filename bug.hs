```haskell
import Data.List (sort)

main :: IO ()
main = do
  let xs = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
  let ys = sort xs
  print ys
```
This code snippet appears correct, but it has a potential issue related to laziness in Haskell.  While it works as expected in this simple example, if `xs` were a very large list, or an infinite list, the call to `sort` would not be efficient.  Because of Haskell's laziness, `sort` will attempt to evaluate the entire list before producing output. This can lead to memory issues or non-termination.
